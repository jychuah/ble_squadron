### Imperial Raider Firmware for Feather HUZZAH 

These are the raw sources for an Adafruit Feather HUZZAH 32, which is an ESP32 module. Before compiling this in the Arduino IDE, you will need to to install the necessary drivers and libraries for both the ESP32 and the Adafruit PWM Driver. You can follow the instructions here:

- [Silicon Labs drivers for the ESP32](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
- [Instructions on installing ESP32 Arduino IDE respository](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#using-through-arduino-ide)
- [Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library)
